Instead of abandoning the makeup community, she decided to improve and unite it! In May 2013, Glambot quickly grew to become the online destination for the largest collection of rare, limited edition and discontinued items. New items added daily!\n\nSellers use the website to estimate how much they'll receive on their items. They ship their items with a prepaid label and we make an offer on their items, which they can accept cash or Glambucks (credit) for future items.\n\nBuyers purchase makeup anywhere from 10-50% off retail prices, can enjoy a free 14 day return policy, and free domestic shipping when purchasing over $30, while international customers get free shipping over $60.",

Something that millions of people will use to spend, save, borrow, and manage their day to day finances; something 10x better than the competition in everything from how you sign up for an account, to working out whether you can really afford that weekend away.\n\nWe’ve got the world class team, with an international banking exec for a CEO, one of the founders of GoCardless as CTO, and some early employees from Hailo (amongst others) creating the micro-service based web scale platform. \n\nAnd together we'll create the first bank built around users’ lives rather than just providing account numbers and sort codes. We’ll redefine banking for the smartphone: real-time, contextual, intelligent, and basically free.\n\nWe’re looking for a Lead App Designer to join the team in London, someone totally obsessed with apps, flows, and simplicity. You’ve worked at startups or as a key member of fast moving consumer app projects, and you've probably designed an app that we know and love. Now you’re looking for your next big challenge!\n\nThe role:\n* You’ll talk to customers – understanding their needs, wants, frustrations, and lives\n* You’ll do end-to-end design. working as part of a small team to Co-create, debate, design, and iterate a next generation banking app\n* You’ll quickly prototype on paper, napkins, and whiteboards; collaborating with engineers on what's possible, as you create higher fidelity models with favourite tool.\n* You’ll design interfaces that will make customers weep with joy. Pixel perfect, where the details, typography, transitions, and human touches create a truly amazing experience.\n* You’re brilliant, but not a prima donna. Uou’ll support the other members of the team in doing what has to be done. \n\nAs  a critical part of the core team, you’ll have a big influence over the direction the bank takes. We will compensate you well and equity is on offer for the right person. Get in touch!",

        "description": "We have released a private beta (iOS) with the help of friends and outsourcing providers, but we are continuing to search for a technical co-founder who wants to shape the future of Vernez with us. Today we have c.100 beta users (so we can speak to each of them) who showed strong interests in the experience and we have built up c.5,000 followers on Instagram. Our focus now is to iterate the app based on user feedback and push for a formal launch (hopefully together with the web version as well).\n\nWe are looking for someone who enjoys cutting edge and scalable technologies, but more importantly someone who wants to see his/ her ideas and products loved by lots (hopefully millions!) of users. The current technology stack is highlighted below, it's probably easiest if you know them already but we are certainly openminded to fast learners and people who have different views on how this should be done!\n\n•\tRestful API written in Go/ (and a websocket API in Python/ Go)\n•\tAWS infrastructure (e.g. distributed processes)\n•\tMongo DB hosted in Mongo HQ (with storage in Amazon S3)\n•\tDocker deployment process\n•\tGithub\n\nThe iOS frontend is a native app in Objective C (with some C++ elements) and the web frontend is currently in Angular.JS.",

Voted as one of CNN's Top 10 Most Innovative Startups of 2014, we are working to create a legal system that is transparent and predictable using artificial intelligence and machine learning to combat injustice and uncertainty. We are backed by Mark Cuban, Jerry Yang (founder of Yahoo!), Steve Case (founder of AOL), NEA, Winklevoss Capital, etc. with over $8.3M in venture capital. \n\nOur first product, FiscalNote Prophecy, allows for easy searching, tracking, and forecasting of legislation (with over 94% accuracy) from all 50 states and Congress, all in real-time. Additionally, we are in development for product lines in the regulatory and case law spaces. As a result, organizations: \n\n* Reduce political risk\n* Decrease costs of regulatory compliance \n* Make real-time decisions in response to government action",

This position requires excellent creative taste, specific technical proficiencies, intuition, and the ability to write things that are easily understood by our worldwide audience. You’ll directly assist Amanda, our Creative Projects Manager, with various tasks to help execute both press and customer-facing content production for the company.\n\nOne of your main responsibilities will be writing and copy-editing casual, highly compelling content about Doxie, such as e-mail newsletters, blog posts, advertising copy, web copy, campaign-specific deliverables, press releases, knowledgebase articles, press pitches, social media posts, and more. You’ll work through multiple iterations of project deliverables until they meet our exacting standards and perform copyediting, technical validation, and brand compliance on all deliverables.\n\nYou’ll need to be able to write in our company’s voice, with strong writing skills (i.e. follow The Elements of Style) and have a comprehensive understanding of our products. As one of our team’s primary writers, you’ll competently engage, entertain, and inform our customers with the written word using our unified voice. You must not merely write, but deeply consider your subject and reader, along with the interplay between words and design. You’ll also contribute to press releases, press pitches, e-mails, public facing responses to criticism, and official statements.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who’s mindful, friendly, communicative, and can bring that to their job – we don’t want to work with a corporate drone. Empathy, compassion, and outstanding communication skills are key – we can teach you all about our scanners and software, but we can’t teach you how to be a caring communicator.
