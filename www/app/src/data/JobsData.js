Can you step up to leadership roles as needed, because it allows you to expand the reach of your craft? When the situation demands it,  can you code up a storm and get a proof of concept out the door that last well past the demo or user test?  Do you understand project management flow and can you foresee bottlenecks (technical or otherwise) and proactively propose solutions? Do you love food as much as you love code?\n\nIf you answered yes to all of these questions, then you're the leader we need. Join our successful, nimble operation that's building products that will change the way the nation eats. \n\nFor our early hires, we are looking for partners rather than just employees. So while this is an opportunity to build foundational technology for a transforming legacy market, it's also an opportunity to influence the character of the company and work environment.\n\nExperience we're looking for:\n\n- Expertise with Rails4 and the rest of our stack (Postgres, Redis, jQuery, Github, Solr, Ember)\n- Previous engineering leadership responsibilities a plus\n- Enthusiasm for solving interesting problems and a passion to take the lead on new product features\n- A self-starter with the drive to work on a rapidly changing, ever-evolving system\n- Firm grasp of testing methodologies and strong scripting abilities\n- BS/MS in Engineering / Computer Science or related field is a plus\n- A collaborative mindset. ",

GCT takes no equity from these companies and charges them no rent, instead asking them to participate in building a robust community;\n\nSecond, to widen the aperture of who has access to the benefits of the tech economy. A major criticism of the startup ecosystem is that its benefits are often constrained to a narrow segment of the population, causing it to stand apart from the rest of the city, rather than as a part of the fabric of the city.",

Housed in Facebook's former NY Headquarters overlooking Grand Central Terminal, GCT has as its goal the challenge of focusing the energy of NY's tech ecosystem on tackling large, lucrative and important problems, rather than derivative or whimsical businesses.\n\nGCT's twofold mission is in the service of achieving these goals:\n\nFirst, to attract the most talented people, working on the biggest problems, by providing them with the best resources at the best terms.  GCT takes no equity from these companies and charges them no rent, instead asking them to participate in building a robust community;\n\nSecond, to widen the aperture of who has access to the benefits of the tech economy. A major criticism of the startup ecosystem is that its benefits are often constrained to a narrow segment of the population, causing it to stand apart from the rest of the city, rather than as a part of the fabric of the city.",

On one side, the 1 in 10 people that move every year have to perform several time consuming research using unreliable sources of information which leads to overspending, unsuitable long-term contracts with service providers and irreversible decisions. \n\nAt the same time, service providers have extremely high customer acquisition cost because they spend their marketing dollars in mass advertising and are unable to identify and reach this market prior to the move.\n\nNavut has developed the Neighborhood Finder which allows people moving to a new city to find their ideal neighbourhood and to:\n- Save time: replaces hours and hours of research\n- Fully personalized: results are based on how important each chosen criteria is for the user\n- Reliability of the results: algorithm accuracy is currently at 90%\n- Connect with local service providers and get deals",

      "description": "Grid Mobile is building a new software platform that makes it simple for businesses to leverage mobile services better, and for individuals to manage both work and personal life on one device. Co-founded by a former founder of Virgin Mobile, The platform is a total replacement of traditional desk phones, allowing employees to have secure access to separate personal and business lines on a single mobile phone, with transparent pricing, radically simplified cost management, and a premier \"white glove\" business support team.\n \nWe’re looking to hire our first Director of Engineering to work in concert with our CTO, a former Director of Engineering at Microsoft (Xbox Division), and lead the growth of our expansive software platform and services. This person will directly manage a team of around 10 engineers and product managers, both here in New York plus a few critical engineers in Europe.  We currently build in Ruby and Erlang, though it’s not necessary to have deep knowledge of these languages. You would also be one of the first 15 people in the company, meaning you would have an integral part in building the team and the direction of the Company. We just closed our first round of funding are set to take off. \n\n\n\n\nWhat we’re looking for in this Director:\n\n\n\n\n-Strong interest in developing highly-scalable, highly-reliable distributed systems\n\n\n\n\n-Knowledge of (or strong interest in learning ) multiple programming paradigms, including Functional and Object-Oriented. Ideally languages like Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Scala, etc.\n\n\n\n\n-Experience managing small cross-functional teams focused on regularly delivering new features in a flexible Agile environment (ideally you’ve helped shape a very productive engineering culture, at any scale).\n",
